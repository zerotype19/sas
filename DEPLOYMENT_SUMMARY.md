2. **Strategy Analysis** (cron at :45 past hour)
   - All 7 strategies evaluate each symbol
   - Phase 3 = Full suite active:
     - `LONG_CALL` (bullish momentum)
     - `BULL_PUT_CREDIT` (bullish income)
     - `LONG_PUT` (bearish momentum)
     - `BEAR_CALL_CREDIT` (bearish income)

## 🎯 STRATEGY DETAILS

### Phase 1 Strategies (Existing, Refactored)

#### Long Call
- **Type:** DEBIT_CALL
- **Bias:** Bullish momentum
- **Entry:** Delta 0.60-0.70, DTE 30-60, IVR ≤ 40
- **Scoring:** `(100 - IVR)/2 + momentum/2`
- **Target:** 2x debit | **Stop:** 0.5x debit

#### Bull Put Credit Spread
- **Type:** CREDIT_SPREAD
- **Bias:** Bullish/neutral income
- **Entry:** Short put delta -0.20 to -0.30, Width $5, DTE 30-45, IVR > 60
- **Scoring:** `IVR/2 + POP/2`
- **Target:** 50% credit | **Stop:** 150% credit

---

### Phase 2 Strategies (NEW)

#### Long Put
- **Type:** DEBIT_PUT
- **Bias:** Bearish momentum
- **Entry:** Delta -0.60, DTE 30-60, IVR 30-70
- **Scoring:** Delta window (35%) + Trend (30%) + IVR (15%) + Liquidity (10%) + R/R (10%)
- **Target:** 2x debit | **Stop:** 0.5x debit

#### Bear Call Credit Spread
- **Type:** CREDIT_SPREAD
- **Bias:** Bearish/neutral income
- **Entry:** Short call delta -0.20 to -0.30, Width $5, DTE 30-45, IVR > 60
- **Scoring:** Delta (30%) + IVR (25%) + Liquidity (15%) + R/R (15%) + Trend (15%)
- **Target:** 50% credit | **Stop:** 150% credit

---

### Phase 3 Strategies (NEW - Advanced)

#### Iron Condor
- **Type:** IRON_CONDOR (4 legs)
- **Bias:** Neutral range-bound
- **Structure:** Sell OTM call spread + Sell OTM put spread
- **Entry:** Balanced short deltas ±0.22, Width $5 each side, DTE 30-45, IVR 20-60, NOT near earnings
- **Scoring:** Symmetry (20%) + IVR (25%) + Liquidity (20%) + R/R (15%) + Neutral trend (20%)
- **Target:** 50% total credit | **Stop:** 150% credit (worst side)

#### Calendar Call Spread
- **Type:** CALENDAR (2 legs, different expiries)
- **Bias:** Volatility expansion (bullish bias)
- **Structure:** Sell near-term call (14-21 DTE) + Buy longer-term call (45-75 DTE)
- **Entry:** Strike near ATM (delta ~0.50), Positive term structure (back IV > front IV by 2+ pts), IVR 10-50
- **Scoring:** Term structure (30%) + Strike placement (20%) + Trend (15%) + IVR (15%) + Liquidity (20%)
- **Target:** 30% gain on net debit | **Stop:** 45% loss

## 🔐 RISK GUARDRAILS (Unchanged)

All strategies enforce:
- ✅ Risk fraction: 0.5% of equity per trade
- ✅ Max quantity: 5 contracts
- ✅ Max notional: $10k per position
- ✅ Paper trading only (`TRADING_MODE=paper`)
- ✅ 24-hour deduplication window
- ✅ Score threshold: ≥50 for alerts

---

## 📖 USAGE

### Check Available Strategies
```bash
# View current phase
echo $SAS_PHASE

# In production: SAS_PHASE=3 (all strategies)
```

### Monitor Strategy Output
```bash
# Real-time strategy analysis
curl https://sas-worker-production.kevin-mcgovern.workers.dev/strategy/run \
  | jq '.candidates[] | {strategy, symbol, score, entry_type, legs: .legs | length}'
```

### Adjust Phase (If Needed)
```toml
# In wrangler.toml [env.production.vars]
SAS_PHASE = "1"  # Conservative: Long Call + Bull Put only
SAS_PHASE = "2"  # Add bearish strategies
SAS_PHASE = "3"  # Full suite (current)
```

---

## 🎓 KEY IMPROVEMENTS

### Before (Phase 2B)
- 2 strategies: Long Call + Bull Put Credit Spread
- Hardcoded in monolithic `strategyRun.ts`
- Single scoring approach
- Limited to 2-leg structures

### After (Phase 3 - Multi-Strategy)
- 7 strategies (6 active + 1 scaffold)
- Modular, testable architecture
- Strategy-specific scoring with weighted factors
- Support for 1-4 leg structures
- Phase gating for progressive rollout
- Trend-aware, IV-aware, liquidity-aware
- Event filtering (earnings blocking)
- Term structure analysis (calendars)

---

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Trend Detection:** Currently returns `NEUTRAL` for all symbols
   - **Impact:** Strategies work but don't leverage directional signals yet
   - **Fix:** Add TA indicators (moving averages, RSI)

2. **Earnings Calendar:** Not integrated
   - **Impact:** Iron Condor earnings filter inactive
   - **Fix:** Add earnings data source

3. **Term Structure:** Calculated from option chain IV
   - **Impact:** Works but could be more precise
   - **Fix:** Use VIX term structure or historical IV

4. **Frontend:** Uses existing proposals UI
   - **Impact:** Strategy labels from old naming convention
   - **Fix:** Update UI to import from `constants/strategyLabels.ts`

---

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### No Proposals Generated?
1. Check option quotes exist: `wrangler d1 execute sas-proposals --remote --env production --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM option_quotes WHERE timestamp > strftime('%s','now')*1000-3600000;"`
2. Check IV history exists: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM iv_history;`
3. Verify SAS_PHASE: `curl .../strategy/run | jq .debug`

### Unexpected Strategy Mix?
- Lower SAS_PHASE to filter strategies
- Adjust `minScore` in `apps/worker/src/config/strategies.ts`

### Iron Condor Not Appearing?
- Requires neutral trend
- Blocks within 7 days of earnings
- Needs balanced delta options (±0.22)

### Calendar Spread Not Appearing?
- Requires positive term structure (back IV > front IV by 2+ pts)
- Needs both 14-21 DTE and 45-75 DTE expiries available
