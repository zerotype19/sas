# Pre-Launch Database Cleanup
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Time:** 8:50 AM EST  
**Action:** Clear all test data before market open

---

## Cleanup Summary

**Deleted 49 rows of test data from production D1 database (`sas-proposals`)**

### Tables Cleared

| Table | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `proposals` | Strategy proposals | ‚úÖ EMPTY (0 rows) |
| `trades` | Order submissions | ‚úÖ EMPTY (0 rows) |
| `market_data` | Stock quotes | ‚úÖ EMPTY (0 rows) |
| `iv_history` | IV snapshots for IV Rank | ‚úÖ EMPTY (0 rows) |
| `option_quotes` | Option chains with greeks | ‚úÖ EMPTY (0 rows) |

### Verification

All tables confirmed empty via D1 queries:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM proposals;  -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trades;     -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM market_data; -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM iv_history; -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM option_quotes; -- 0
```

Schema intact: All tables and columns preserved. Only data deleted, not structure.

---

## Why This Was Necessary

### Before Cleanup
The database contained synthetic test data from:
- Dry-run tests during Phase 2B implementation
- Strategy smoke tests with mock option chains
- Synthetic IV history seeded for testing
- Test proposals with fake scores and legs
- Test trades from UI execution tests

### Problems With Test Data
- **Confusion:** Mix of real and test data makes Day 1 analysis unclear
- **Metrics:** Polluted baseline for success criteria
- **Debugging:** Hard to distinguish test vs production issues
- **Integrity:** Test data might trigger deduplication logic
- **Version tracking:** Mixed engine versions from different builds

### After Cleanup
- **Clean slate:** All data from Day 1 will be real production data
- **Clear metrics:** No ambiguity about what's test vs real
- **Pure tracking:** All proposals/trades will have today's engine_version
- **Deduplication works:** No false positives from old test data
- **Easy analysis:** Query results will only show real trading activity

## Expected Data Population After Market Open

### 9:30 AM - Market Opens
- Market hours guard automatically lifts
- Data pipeline activates

### 9:35 AM - First Manual Pass
```bash
curl https://sas-worker-production.kevin-mcgovern.workers.dev/strategy/run?force=true | jq
```

Expected D1 row counts after first pass:

| Table | Expected Rows | Content |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `market_data` | ~10 | Live quotes for universe symbols (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, etc.) |
| `option_quotes` | ~500-1000 | Option chains with real greeks from IBKR |
| `iv_history` | ~10 | ATM IV snapshots for IV Rank calculation |
| `proposals` | 5-10 | Real strategy proposals (score ‚â•50) |
| `trades` | 0 | No trades until user approves proposals |

### 9:45 AM - First Cron Run
- Automated ingestion and analysis
- Additional proposals generated
- Telegram alerts sent (score ‚â•50)

### 10:00 AM - First Approvals
- User approves 3-5 high-confidence proposals
- Trades table populates with paper orders
- Status tracking: pending ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí acknowledged

---

## Cleanup Script Used

```sql
-- Clear all test data from D1 tables
DELETE FROM option_quotes;
DELETE FROM iv_history;
DELETE FROM market_data;
DELETE FROM trades;
DELETE FROM proposals;

-- Verify all tables are empty
SELECT 'proposals' as table_name, COUNT(*) as rows FROM proposals
UNION ALL
SELECT 'trades', COUNT(*) FROM trades
UNION ALL
SELECT 'market_data', COUNT(*) FROM market_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 'iv_history', COUNT(*) FROM iv_history
UNION ALL
SELECT 'option_quotes', COUNT(*) FROM option_quotes;
```

### Execution
```bash
cd /Users/kevinmcgovern/sas
wrangler d1 execute sas-proposals --file cleanup.sql --remote
```

### Result
```
Total queries executed: 7
Rows read: 28
Rows written: 49
Changes: 50
Database size: 0.09 MB
```

## Benefits for Day 1

### 1. Clean Metrics
All queries will return only real production data:
```sql
-- Strategy mix from today only
SELECT strategy, COUNT(*) as n, ROUND(AVG(score),1) as avg_score
FROM proposals
WHERE created_at > strftime('%s','now')*1000 - 3600000
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 2. Clear Version Tracking
All proposals/trades will have today's engine version:
```sql
-- Should show only one version (today's build)
SELECT engine_version, COUNT(*) as n
FROM proposals
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 3. Accurate Success Criteria
Day-1 success criteria can be evaluated without filtering out test data:
- Strategy diversity: Clear count by type
- Quality bar: Clean score ‚â•70 count
- Order execution: Only real paper trades
- Version tracking: All rows from today

### 4. Simplified Debugging
If issues occur:
- No need to filter `WHERE created_at > ...`
- No confusion about which data is real
- Easier to trace flow from quote ‚Üí proposal ‚Üí trade
- Clear correlation between data and logs

---

## Post-Cleanup Verification Queries

### Empty State (Before Market Open)
```sql
-- All should return 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM proposals;    -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trades;       -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM market_data;  -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM iv_history;   -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM option_quotes; -- 0
```

### After First Pass (9:35 AM)
```sql
-- Should see real data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM market_data;  -- ~10
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM option_quotes; -- ~500-1000
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM proposals;    -- 5-10

-- All proposals should have today's engine version
SELECT DISTINCT engine_version FROM proposals;
-- Expected: 3c253a21-d9e5-4b1a-874b-0f031d787428

-- All proposals should be from last 10 minutes
SELECT 
  (strftime('%s','now')*1000 - created_at) / 60000 as minutes_ago,
  symbol, strategy, score
FROM proposals
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Impact on System Behavior

### Deduplication
With test data cleared:
- Deduplication logic starts fresh
- No false positives from old test proposals
- `dedupe_key` tracking will be clean

### Cron Jobs
- First cron at 9:45 AM will be first real ingestion
- No stale timestamps to confuse scheduling
- Clear start time for hourly cadence

### Telegram Alerts
- First alert will be from real proposal
- No confusion about which alerts are test vs real
- Easy to correlate alerts with UI cards

### Web UI
- All proposals displayed are real
- No need to filter by date
- Clean proposal list from Day 1

---

## Backup Considerations

### Schema Preserved
- Only data deleted, not table structure
- All migrations remain intact
- Indexes and constraints preserved

### No Data Loss Risk
- Test data was synthetic (no real value)
- All test scenarios covered by automated tests
- Can regenerate test data anytime via test suite

### Recovery Not Needed
- This was intentional cleanup before production launch
- No production data existed to lose
- Starting fresh is the goal

## Next Steps

### At Market Open (9:30 AM)
1. ‚úÖ Database is clean
2. ‚è≥ Wait for quotes to flow
3. ‚è≥ Run first manual pass at 9:35 AM

### First Hour (9:30-10:30 AM)
1. Verify data is populating correctly
2. Check all tables have expected row counts
3. Confirm engine_version is consistent
4. Approve 3-5 high-confidence proposals

### End of Day (4:00 PM)
1. Run final metrics queries
2. Export Day 1 data for analysis
3. Review success criteria (5/5 expected)
4. Document any tuning needed for Day 2
