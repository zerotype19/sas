# IV/RV Analytics Implementation Status

**Date:** October 30, 2024  
**Branch:** `feat/ivrv-metrics`  
**Status:** üü° In Progress (Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Starting)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

### Analytics Layer
- ‚úÖ `realizedVol.ts` - RV10, RV20, RV30 calculators
- ‚úÖ `ivrv.ts` - IV/RV metrics, skew spreads, delta selection
- ‚úÖ `scoreIvrvEdge()` - Scoring factor for credit/debit strategies

### Data Layer
- ‚úÖ `volatility_metrics` D1 table with migration
- ‚úÖ `history.ts` - Data fetcher for daily prices
- ‚úÖ `/history/daily` broker endpoint (mock + live modes)

### Tests
- ‚úÖ 26 tests passing
  - `realizedVol.test.ts` (5 tests)
  - `ivrv.test.ts` (9 tests)
  - `ivrvEdge.test.ts` (12 tests)

### Broker Service
- ‚úÖ Mock daily bars generator with deterministic random walks
- ‚úÖ Ready for live IBKR historical data on Nov 1st

## üü° Phase 2: Strategy Integration (IN PROGRESS)

**Next Steps:**

### 8. Wire into Strategy Runner
- [ ] Add history fetching to `strategyRun.ts`
- [ ] Compute RV20 from closes
- [ ] Calculate IV/RV metrics from option chains
- [ ] Persist metrics to D1
- [ ] Attach `ivrvMetrics` to `StrategyInput`

### 9. Strategy-Level Integration
- [ ] Add `ENABLE_IVRV_EDGE` flag support
- [ ] Update Bull Put Credit (use `put_skew_ivrv_spread`)
- [ ] Update Bear Call Credit (use `call_skew_ivrv_spread`)
- [ ] Update Long Call/Put (inverse preference)
- [ ] Update Iron Condor (average spreads)

### 10. Deployment & Testing
- [ ] Deploy Worker with flag OFF
- [ ] Test with mock data
- [ ] Verify metrics table population
- [ ] Enable flag and compare scores
- [ ] Document results

## üìä Key Metrics Explained

### IV/RV Ratio
- **ATM IV/RV**: Baseline volatility pricing
- **OTM Call IV/RV**: Call wing pricing
- **OTM Put IV/RV**: Put wing pricing

### Skew Spreads
- **Call Skew Spread**: `OTM Call IV/RV - ATM IV/RV`
  - Positive = calls more expensive (good for selling)
  - Used by: Bear Call Credit, Iron Condor
- **Put Skew Spread**: `OTM Put IV/RV - ATM IV/RV`
  - Positive = puts more expensive (good for selling)
  - Used by: Bull Put Credit, Iron Condor

### IV Premium %
- `(IV - RV) / RV * 100`
- Shows how much implied vol exceeds realized
- Positive = expensive options (good for selling)
- Negative = cheap options (good for buying)

---

## üéØ Feature Flag Behavior

### ENABLE_IVRV_EDGE = false (default)
- Existing scoring unchanged
- Metrics collected but not used
- Safe rollout

### ENABLE_IVRV_EDGE = true
- IV/RV edge becomes 20-30% of total score
- Credit strategies favor high skew spreads
- Debit strategies favor low/negative spreads
- Neutral fallback (score=50) when data unavailable

---

## üìà Expected Impact

### Credit Strategies (Bull Put, Bear Call)
- **Before:** Mostly IVR + delta alignment
- **After:** Also favor high IV/RV skew (expensive wings)
- **Score boost:** +10-15 points in high-IV environments

### Debit Strategies (Long Call, Long Put)
- **Before:** Mostly trend + momentum
- **After:** Also favor low IV/RV (cheap options)
- **Score boost:** +10-15 points in low-IV environments

### Iron Condor
- **After:** Favors high IV on both sides
- **Best conditions:** High ATM IV + elevated skew

## üöÄ Deployment Plan

1. **Deploy with flag OFF** (today in mock mode)
2. **Verify data collection** (metrics table populates)
3. **Test with flag ON** (compare proposal scores)
4. **Monitor for 24-48 hours** (ensure stability)
5. **Flip to LIVE mode** (Nov 1st with real data)
6. **Fine-tune thresholds** (adjust 0.25 spread threshold if needed)

---

## üîÑ Rollback Strategy

If issues arise:
```bash
# Instant rollback
wrangler secret put ENABLE_IVRV_EDGE --env production
# enter: false

# Full rollback
git revert <commit-hash>
wrangler deploy --env production
```

The `volatility_metrics` table is additive-only and safe to leave in place.

## üìù Notes

- Mock mode generates deterministic price data for testing
- Seeded by `symbol + date` for reproducibility
- RV calculations use log returns with 252-day annualization
- IV selection targets ¬±0.50 delta (ATM) and ¬±0.20 delta (OTM)
- Fallback scoring (50/100) handles missing data gracefully

**Status:** Ready to proceed with Phase 2 integration
